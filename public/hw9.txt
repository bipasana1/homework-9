1. What is SQL? What are relational databases?

    Relational databases are a type of database that organizes data into rows and columns, which collectively form a table where the 
    data points are related to one another. 

4. What is a PDO in PHP? Why do we need to use prepared statements?
    PDO in PHP stands for PHP Data Objects. PDO acts as a middleman between your PHP code and the underlying database system.
    Prepared statements are a fundamental security measure in PDO and other database access methods. They involve separating 
    the SQL code from the data you want to insert or retrieve.
